 carliv_mkbootimg_tools
 
 Source code for building executables for Carliv Image Kitchen. 
The base files are from Cyanogenmod repo with Omnirom MTK implementation and Pete Batard fix for windows. I worked with all these and created a personalized version for using with my Kitchen.

To build run `make all` or `make all target=32` for 32bit executables.
The built binaries will be in `out` folder.
