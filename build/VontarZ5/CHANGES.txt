The difference between the modified and the stock kernel:

  * Modified kernel is based on the AMLogic kernel source released on 16th May 2017.
    Stock kernel is based on an older AMLogic kernel source (Oct-2016 or so).

  * Implemented colorspace force mode for HDMI output. Now you can force one of
    the following output modes:

        RGB444 - "usual" mode as used by all computer monitors. 8 bit for every
                 of the R,G,B components, 24 bits per pixel.
        YUV444 - also known as YCbCr 4:4:4, high-quality video output mode,
                 Y,U,V components (brightness Y and two chromatic values U & V)
                 use 8 bit per every pixel, 24 bits per pixel.
        YUV422 - also known as YCbCr 4:2:2, standard mode, used for encoding in MPEG
                 and JPEG standards, the Y component (brightness) is defined for every
                 pixel, the U and V components are defined once for every two horizontally
                 adjanced pixels. 32 bits per 2 pixels, or 16 bits per pixel.
        YUV420 - also known as YCbCr 4:2:0, lower-quality mode used with limited bandwidth.
                 Brightness Y is defined for every pixel, but chroma values U & V are
                 defined once per every group of 2x2 pixels.
                 48 bits per 4 pixels, or 12 bits per pixel.

    To change the current mode, write the name of desired mode into the sysfs attribute
    force_color_space:

        echo rgb444 > /sys/class/amhdmitx/amhdmitx0/force_color_space

    To restore default mode (autodetect using TV EDID data), write AUTO to this attribute:

        echo auto > /sys/class/amhdmitx/amhdmitx0/force_color_space

  * Implemented color depth switching for HDMI output:

	echo 0  > /sys/class/amhdmitx/amhdmitx0/force_color_depth
	echo 24 > /sys/class/amhdmitx/amhdmitx0/force_color_depth
	echo 30 > /sys/class/amhdmitx/amhdmitx0/force_color_depth
	echo 36 > /sys/class/amhdmitx/amhdmitx0/force_color_depth
	echo 48 > /sys/class/amhdmitx/amhdmitx0/force_color_depth

    The default value is 0, which gives same behaviour as stock kernel
    (always 24 bits per pixel).

  * Implemented color quantization range switching
    (see HDMI 1.3 specs, chapter 6.6 "Video Quantization Ranges"):

        echo MODE > /sys/class/amhdmitx/amhdmitx0/force_color_range

    where MODE is one of:

        default - for RGB colors range from 16 to 235 (below 16 - black, above 235 - white)
                  for YUB colors (video) - Y from 16 to 235, Cb and Cr - from 16 to 240
        limited - for RGB colors range from 16 to 240
                  for YUB colors (video) - Y from 16 to 235, Cb and Cr - from 16 to 240
        full    - for RGB colors range from 1 to 254 (standard does not allow 0 and 255)
                  for YUB colors (video) - from 1 to 254
        all     - for RGB colors range from 0 to 255 (non-standard)
                  for YUB colors (video) - from 0 to 255

    After rebooting the mode is "default".
