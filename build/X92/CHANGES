The difference between the modified and the stock X92 kernel:

  * Modified kernel is based on the AMLogic kernel source released on 2017 10-Mar.
    Stock kernel is based on an older AMLogic kernel source (Oct-2016 or so).

  * The LED display driver (named 'vfd') has been rewritten from scratch,
    since the AMLogic sources do not contain it.
    The driver in modified kernel is way more advanced.
    To drive the LED display there's a daemon running now in background named vfdd.
    It is placed in boot.img (on initramfs), so it will start automatically only
    when you boot the modified kernel.

    This driver and daemon is available separately from the GitHub:
