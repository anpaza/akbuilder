The difference between the modified and the stock X92 kernel:

  * Modified kernel is based on the AMLogic kernel source released on 2017 10-Mar.
    Stock kernel is based on an older AMLogic kernel source (Oct-2016 or so).

  * The LED display driver (named 'vfd') has been rewritten from scratch,
    since the AMLogic sources do not contain it.
    The driver in modified kernel is way more advanced.
    To drive the LED display there's a daemon running now in background named vfdd.
    It is placed in boot.img (on initramfs), so it will start automatically only
    when you boot the modified kernel.

    In current configuration vfdd displays on the LED display sequentially
    the current time (9 seconds), then current date as "month day" (e.g. 05 09 - May 9),
    then current CPU temperature in degrees Celsius. Also the following blinking icons
    are used to show disk accesses:

        USB - blinks when reading from USB storage
        APPS - blinks when writing to USB storage
        CARD - blinks when reading from internal memory
        SETUP - blinks when writing to internal memory

    This driver and daemon is available separately from the GitHub:
